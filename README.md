Trees
=====
This is Binary Search Tree Symbol Table API and contains various methods to manipulate symbol table.There are also various methods to query Binary Search Trees.

There is also implementation of left leaning RED-BLACK trees which guarantees the the balance property of Binary Search Trees(amazingly simple)

I am also looking forward for the implementation of K-d trees.Any help will be most welcome.
